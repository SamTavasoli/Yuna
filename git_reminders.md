# Git Reminders

## Git Command Cheat Sheet

- `git status`
    - see the status of changed, new, or deleted files, and which files are staged.
- `git add <filename>`
    - "stage" a file to be committed. Stage means like add it to a list to the committed.
- `git commit -m "your message here"`
    - Make a checkpoint in your code. This checkpoint is called a commit.
- `git push`
    - Sync your changes with github
